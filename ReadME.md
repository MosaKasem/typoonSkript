# Ass TDD 1 part 2

### Run *dotnet run* inside typoonSkript folder to run the app
### Run *dotnet test* inside typoonSkript TTD to run the tests


##### Mistakes gained from this was..

There was no guideline on how to start things, for instance I didn't know I could create the methods inside xunit and then later move the methods inside a class after they'v been validated.

Mocking didn't work great because my application is rather simply.
Moq has terrible documentation.

I didn't know you could have multiple Asserts.. that would have been made things alot easier.

Most of the time I found myself trying to learn how xunit works and moq aswell.
