###### My Experience with TDD (This will be removed after grading)

There is no proper way of testing a method that asks user for input (never gotten a proper answer) Wrapper doesn't solve the problem of the method still requires/awaits an input from user.

Xunit and Moq experience was very toxic.

There are alot of things that goes without mention but discovered by searching the web.. didnn't know multiple Asserts were possible inside a testcase.

My mistake was the I didn't really have a plan with the calculator other than I wanted to experience how TDD works.

Had I known a simple application like this wouldn't fill the requirement, I would'v opted for something else.. too late now.

Lack of resources, guides on setting up the enviroment of Xunit.
Microsofts documentation have always been frustrating for me since the beginning.

TDD or Xunit that's horrible... I dont know..
When I split the calculator's methods into multiple classes, I had to update the tests, and some were no longer relevant.
